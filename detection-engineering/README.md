# Detection Engineering

This directory contains detection rules, methodologies, and documentation developed as part of my detection engineering practice. The focus is on creating high-quality, well-documented detection logic across multiple platforms and rule types.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sigma-rules/` | Sigma detection rules for various platforms |
| `yara-rules/` | YARA rules for file and memory scanning |
| `suricata-rules/` | Suricata network detection rules |
| `documentation/` | Methodologies and best practices |

## üéØ Detection Principles

All detection rules in this repository follow these core principles:

1. **Evidence-Based**: Built on observed threat actor behavior or validated techniques
2. **Well-Documented**: Include clear descriptions, logic explanations, and references
3. **MITRE Mapped**: Associated with relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques
4. **Tested**: Validated against real or simulated data
5. **Tunable**: Include guidance on false positive handling and tuning

## üß† Development Methodology

Each detection rule follows this development process:

1. **Research Phase**: Study threat behavior, TTPs, and existing detection approaches
2. **Logic Development**: Craft initial detection logic with careful field selection
3. **Testing**: Validate against known-good and known-bad data
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation including context
5. **Publication**: Add to repository with metadata and references
6. **Maintenance**: Update based on feedback and evolving threats

## üîé Rule Format

Sigma rules follow this structure:
```yaml

## üìä Current Status

| Rule Type | Count | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Sigma | 2 | In Development |
| YARA | 0 | Planned Q2 2025 |
| Suricata | 0 | Planned Q3 2025 |

## üß™ Integration with Threat Hunting

The detection rules in this directory are developed in concert with the threat hunting activities documented in the `threat-hunting/` directory. Many rules originated from successful hunt hypotheses that were converted into production detections.
