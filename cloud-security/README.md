# Cloud Security

This directory contains cloud security detection rules, methodologies, and tooling for AWS, Azure, and GCP environments. The focus is on cloud-native threat detection with special attention to IAM, infrastructure, and runtime security.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `aws/` | AWS-specific detection rules and methodologies |
| `azure/` | Azure-specific detection rules and methodologies |
| `gcp/` | GCP-specific detection rules and methodologies |
| `runtime/` | Container and runtime security components |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Security Approach

The cloud security components in this repository follow these principles:

1. **Cloud-Native**: Leveraging cloud-specific logs and APIs
2. **IAM-Focused**: Emphasis on identity and access management risks
3. **Multi-Cloud**: Consistent approaches across AWS, Azure, and GCP
4. **Detection-as-Code**: Implementing detection logic as code
5. **Runtime Visibility**: Integrating container and runtime security

## üîê AWS Security Components

AWS security detection and response:

1. **CloudTrail Analysis**: Detection rules for CloudTrail logs
2. **GuardDuty Enhancement**: Custom detection to enhance GuardDuty
3. **IAM Security**: Focus on identity and privilege misuse
4. **S3 Security**: Object storage security monitoring
5. **VPC Traffic**: Network traffic analysis in AWS environments
