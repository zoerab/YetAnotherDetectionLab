# 🧪 YetAnotherDetectionLab

Welcome to my detection engineering & threat hunting lab — a living portfolio that documents my journey from on-prem threat hunting to cloud-native detection engineering.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This repo showcases my work in:

- 📦 Detection rule creation (Sigma, YARA, Suricata)
- 🐍 Python automation for threat detection & enrichment
- ⚙️ Cortex XSOAR playbook development
- ☁️ Cloud-native threat detection and response
- 🧪 Real-world threat simulation and hunting

Each project is **built, tested, and documented** as part of my transition into a **Cloud Threat Detection Engineer** role.
