# Automation

This directory contains automation scripts, playbooks, and CI/CD configurations developed to enhance detection engineering and threat hunting workflows. The focus is on creating reusable components that streamline security operations and improve detection capabilities.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scripts/` | Python scripts for data enrichment, parsing, and analysis |
| `playbooks/` | Cortex XSOAR playbooks for automated response |
| `ci-cd/` | CI/CD configurations for detection-as-code pipelines |

## üêç Python Scripts

Python scripts in this repository follow these core principles:

1. **Modular Design**: Built with reusability and extensibility in mind
2. **Well-Documented**: Include docstrings, usage examples, and clear comments
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and graceful failure modes
4. **Input Validation**: Careful validation of all inputs
5. **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality

### Current Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| [ioc_enricher.py](scripts/ioc_enricher.py) | Enrich IOCs with threat intelligence from multiple sources | Active |

## ‚öôÔ∏è XSOAR Playbooks

Cortex XSOAR playbooks for security orchestration and automated response:

1. **Modular Design**: Built with reusable components
2. **Clear Documentation**: Include purpose, inputs, outputs, and flow diagrams
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Integration Testing**: Validated in test environments

### Playbook Development Roadmap

| Playbook | Purpose | Target Date |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| IOC Enrichment | Automate enrichment of indicators with TI data | Q1 2025 |
| Alert Triage | Prioritize and contextualize security alerts | Q2 2025 |
| Incident Response | Automate initial incident response actions | Q3 2025 |

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipelines

CI/CD configurations for implementing detection-as-code:

1. **Automated Testing**: Test detection rules against sample data
2. **Validation**: Validate syntax and structure of rules
3. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to production environments
4. **Documentation**: Generate documentation from rule metadata

### CI/CD Development Roadmap

| Pipeline | Purpose | Target Date |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Sigma Validation | Validate Sigma rule syntax and structure | Q2 2025 |
| Detection Testing | Test detection rules against sample data | Q3 2025 |
| Full Deployment | Automate deployment to production | Q4 2025 |

## üìä Automation Goals

The automation components in this directory aim to achieve these goals:

1. **Reduce Manual Work**: Automate repetitive security tasks
2. **Improve Consistency**: Ensure consistent execution of security processes
3. **Enhance Detection**: Support more sophisticated detection capabilities
4. **Accelerate Response**: Reduce time from detection to response
5. **Enable Scaling**: Allow detection capabilities to scale efficiently

## üß™ Integration with Other Components

The automation in this directory integrates with:

- **Detection Engineering**: Automate testing and deployment of detection rules
- **Threat Hunting**: Support data enrichment and hypothesis validation
- **Incident Response**: Automate response actions and evidence collection
