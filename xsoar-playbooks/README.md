# XSOAR Playbooks

This directory contains Cortex XSOAR playbooks for security orchestration, automation, and response. The focus is on building reusable, well-documented playbooks that enhance detection capabilities and streamline incident response.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `detection/` | Playbooks focused on detection enhancement |
| `enrichment/` | Playbooks for data enrichment and context |
| `response/` | Playbooks for incident response automation |
| `templates/` | Template playbooks and documentation |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Playbook Development Approach

All XSOAR playbooks in this repository follow these principles:

1. **Modularity**: Building reusable components that can be combined
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of inputs, outputs, and flow
4. **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance and resource usage
5. **Integration**: Leveraging diverse security tools and APIs

## üîç Detection Playbooks

Playbooks for enhancing detection capabilities:

1. **Alert Triage**: Automated alert assessment and prioritization
2. **Detection Tuning**: Dynamic tuning of detection rules
3. **Threat Intelligence**: Integration of threat intelligence
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Automated anomaly detection workflows

### Current Detection Playbooks

| Playbook | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Alert Triage | Automated assessment and enrichment of alerts | Planned Q2 2025 |
| TI Integration | Integrate threat intelligence into detection | Planned Q2 2025 |

## üîé Enrichment Playbooks

Playbooks for data enrichment and contextualization:

1. **IOC Enrichment**: Enriching indicators with threat intelligence
2. **Entity Enrichment**: Adding context to entities (users, hosts, etc.)
3. **OSINT Integration**: Leveraging open-source intelligence
4. **Multi-Source Correlation**: Correlating data from multiple sources

### Current Enrichment Playbooks

| Playbook | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| IOC Enrichment | Enrich indicators with threat intelligence | Planned Q1 2025 |
| User Context | Add context to user entities | Planned Q2 2025 |

## üõ°Ô∏è Response Playbooks

Playbooks for automated incident response:

1. **Initial Response**: Automated initial response actions
2. **Containment**: Automated containment measures
3. **Investigation**: Guided investigation workflows
4. **Recovery**: Automated recovery processes

### Current Response Playbooks

| Playbook | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Initial Response | Automated initial incident response | Planned Q3 2025 |
| Credential Compromise | Respond to credential compromise | Planned Q3 2025 |

## üß© Integration Points

The XSOAR playbooks integrate with:

1. **Detection Rules**: Enhancing detection with automation
2. **Threat Intelligence**: Leveraging intelligence in playbooks
3. **Incident Response**: Automating response actions
4. **Case Management**: Integration with case management systems

## üìä Playbook Metrics

Metrics for evaluating playbook effectiveness:

1. **Time Savings**: Reduction in manual effort
2. **False Positive Reduction**: Improvement in alert quality
3. **Response Time**: Reduction in time to respond
4. **Investigation Quality**: Improvement in investigation depth

## üß™ Testing and Validation

Approach to testing and validating playbooks:

1. **Development Testing**: Testing during development
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing integration with other systems
3. **Scenario Testing**: Testing against realistic scenarios
4. **Performance Testing**: Evaluating performance and scalability
